            <p>Welcome to my portfolio page. I would like to first thank you for taking the time to learn more about who
                I am. I love to build and scale companies. I have founded two previous companies, one was recently
                acquired. I am very fourtante to have had the opportunity to learn from my previous failures and
                successes.
            </p>

            <p>This year I made the decision that I want to be in a position to help other start-ups looking to grow and
                scale their own companies. I made the decision to go to the University of California, San Diego's,
                Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp program to sharpen my development skills.
            </p>

            <p>If you have any questions about me, start-up questions, or how many games Notre Dame is going to win this
                season in football, please use the contact form above.
