                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio page. I would to first say thank you for reviewing my webpage. I would describe myself as someone who has a "whatever it takes to get the job done right" attitude. For someone reason, it is something I was instilled in me by my parents at a very early age. No matter how large the barrier is to complete, me and my team will find a way to get the project successfully to the finish line!  A great example of this in my personal life is when my wife and I became engaged.  We wanted to throw an awesome wedding for my friends and family without depleting our savings account. I accepted the challenge of generating $20,000 in 90 days. I accomplished that goal with 10 days to spare. It all started with buying and selling 1100 pairs of women's shoes in 72 hours. Check out the pictures HERE.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Something that sets me apart as a developer is, I look at things as an entrepreneur. I have founded 2 companies, bootstrapped them to scale, and I have had one successful exit. I always try and build things in a manner that fits the project. I want to see my code help your business scale.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>If you have any more questions about me, my experience, or how many games is Notre Dame going to win in Football, please use the contact form above.
